======================

This is a deep-learning project, prepared for BUETUGCSE472 course.


PREPARATION
-----------

1. Clone this repo and cd into it.
2. Download the GTZAN dataset from kaggle.
3. Move the dataset to the proper location.

    mkdir -p ./input
    mv ~/Downloads/GTZAN_data.zip input

4. Create and activate a virtualenv.

    virtualenv create mlproj
    source ./mlproj/bin/activate    # Linux
    "./mlproj/Scripts/activate"     # Windows

5. Install required packages with the following commands

    pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Extract the features.

    python3 extract_features.py

7. Deactivate the virtualenv (or simply close the terminal)

Now you should have a `data.csv` in your project root. That file contains the
extracted features.
